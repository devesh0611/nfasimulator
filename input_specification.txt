First line of input conatins the number of vertices in the graph of input NFA.
Second line of input contains the number of edges in the graph of input NFA.
Third line of input contains the initial or start state(vertex).
Fourth line of input contains the number of final states int he graph of input NFA.
Fifth line of input contains the space separated final states(vertices).
Next (nuber of edges) lines contains the information about edges.
These are space separated 3 integer values.
First value specifies the outgoing node(vertex).
Second value specifies the ingoing node(vertex).
Third value specifies the character of input string on which the transition is taking place.(for example: on the set of input alphabets (0, 1). Third value can be 0 or 1).
(The NFA specifications given in inpt.txt file accepts all strings over 0 and 1 in which third symbol from the right end is always zero).
